<time>29 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The Internet’s collective heart is broken thanks to Season 3 of Orange Is the New Black. It’s been three weeks since the show debuted its latest installment on Netflix, and the time has come to round up the most emotionally devastating moments. We’re talking moments that will make you want to shake your computer and sob “NOOOOOOO” (a common side-effect of binge-watching), and moments that will have you spoon-feeding yourself comfort ice cream.</p><p>The ladies of Litchfield took us on a roller coaster ride of emotions this season –– from Piper’s (<strong>Taylor Schilling</strong>) shifting relationship status, to Bennett’s (<strong>Matt McGorry</strong>) transformation into the World’s Most Hated Man Ever, to Soso’s (<strong>Kimiko Glenn</strong>) flirtation with suicide. Check out the most sob-inducing scenes below –– and be forewarned: Spoilers abound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>1. Piper Cheated On Alex, Continues to Be the Worst&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Let’s discuss Piper’s transformation from a kale-eating yuppie into a ruthless panty-peddling criminal who breaks hearts like it’s her job. Despite scheming last season to bring Alex (<strong>Laura Prepon</strong>) back to Litchfield, Piper’s eye quickly wandered –– straight over to Stella (<strong>Ruby Rose</strong>). The crazy part? Piper seemed totally unfazed by betraying Alex, going so far as to flaunt her new relationship. The newly minted panty boss was stone-cold as she left her longtime love in the dust (or the greenhouse).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>2. Nicky Was Put in Max, the Internet Collectively Wept</strong></p><p>Thanks to some casual heroin dealing gone terribly wrong, Nicky (<strong>Natasha Lyonne</strong>) was hauled off to maximum security during the early part of the season –– a place Litchfield prisoners fear even more than the SHU. Natasha Lyonne’s performance, complete with her drug-addicted backstory, was solid gold, and the expression on her face as Nicky approached her new home was Emmy-worthy. Natasha for all the awards!</p><p><strong>3. Pennsatucky Was Sexually Assaulted, There Are No Words</strong></p><p>Who’d have thought in Season 1 that we would care about what happened to Tiffany “Pennsatucky” Doggett? Pennsatucky’s (<strong>Taryn Manning</strong>) rape scene was so upsetting and unexpected that fans are still recovering, but the most painful part of the ordeal was watching her admit to Big Boo (<strong>Lea DeLaria</strong>) that instead of being angry that it happened, she was “just sad.” Her rapist, C.O. Charlie “I Heart Donuts” Coates (<strong>James McMenamin</strong>), better get what’s coming to him next season. Jolly Rancher shiv, anyone?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>4. Bennett Abandoned Daya, Ruined Our Lives While Doing So</strong></p><p>Remember back in the good ol’ days when you’d dreamy-sigh your way through scenes with Bennett and Daya (<strong>Dascha Polanco</strong>)? And then Bennett popped the question, and you were like “love is real!” Yeah, well he left Daya and their child, and was never heard from again, rendering him the Most Loathed Man in America. He’d better not show his face in Litchfield again (but we secretly miss him and hope he’ll come back in Season 4).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Piper Sold Out Stella, Continues to Be Cutthroat</strong></p><p>Piper’s dirty panty business really did a number on her ability to act like a normal person. Not only did she ditch Alex, but she also framed Stella two days before she was about to get out of Litch for hiding contraband as punishment for stealing her panty profits. This harsh reaction would be understandable –– you know, if their entire feud didn’t center around dirty underwear.</p><p><strong>6. Soso Tried to Kill Herself, We Cared</strong></p><p>Watching the decline of Soso’s typically cheerful personality was a bummer to say the least –– especially because her depression stemmed from the bullying she endured at the hands of her fellow inmates. Fortunately, Soso’s overdose on Benadryl didn’t kill her, and she managed to make a few friends during her recovery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>7. Sophia Was Thrown in the SHU, Might Never Re-Emerge&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Litchfield’s prisoners have always seemed relatively on board with Sophia (<strong>Laverne Cox</strong>) being transgender, but this season? Not so much. After an accidental scuffle with Gloria (<strong>Selenis Leyva</strong>), the inmates started questioning if a “man” should be allowed in their prison. Sophia’s story took a turn for the horrible when she was beaten by her former allies, who demanded to see her genitals. When she threatened to go to the tabloids with her story, Litchfield’s corporate overlords threw her in the SHU. Nope, not okay.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>8. Red and Healy Had a Moment So Tender It Was Tear-Provoking</strong></p><p>Red (<strong>Kate Mulgrew</strong>) and Healy (<strong>Michael Harney</strong>) have reached shipper-levels of cuteness, and this season they were flirting up a storm. The heartbreaking part? First of all, they never actually got together, and second of all, Red admitted, in an emotional monologue, that she was using her womanly wiles to manipulate Healy into reinstating her in the kitchen. That being said, we’re going to hold onto the hope that Red and Healy will be next season’s Daya and Bennett. Lord knows viewers need something to get them through OITNB withdrawal…</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Which moment really broke your heart this season?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOqKmappeaeqq%2FjK2fnmWemsRursuamqRlo5qutLvNZmpmpZ%2BowW60xJqprZqimq6stc2gZKannZq7tb%2BMa2dqbWJqgw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2forange-is-the-new-black-season-3-most-heartbreaking-moments-2015256.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./felix-blumenfeld-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./felix-blumenfeld-net-worth.html>What is Felix Blumenfeld Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./noah-munck.html>Noah Munck- Net Worth, Age, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Height, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./noah-munck.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
